# As The Prospects Eyes Glazed Over, Joe's Folder Dropped On The Floor And The Contents Spilled Out...

Joe the estate agent had tried every trick in the book to get a commitment from Mrs Gooding for over an hour. But no matter how many facts and figures he tossed her way he still hadn't convinced Mrs Gooding to sell her property with him and sign on the dotted line.

And now here he was, bent double under the coffee table, frantically trying to pull all his papers together when Mrs Gooding said, "wait!"

This surprised Joe as it was the first sound he'd heard from her for quite a while. As he looked up from his awkward position on the floor, he realized she was holding one of the letters he'd received that morning from a client. He often received these from clients and stuffed them in his folder to read on the road.

"Do you have any more of these", she asked, without taking her eyes away from the letter. Joe scrambled to recover the rest of the paperwork and then shuffled through it making a separate pile and placing it on the coffee table next to her.

"If you mean letters and cards like the one you're reading, then that pile is just a small sample I get regularly", Joe said.

"Do you mind if I read a few of them", asked Mrs Gooding slowly, concentrating intently on the one in her hand.

At this point Joe was happy to get a break and gather his thoughts for his next push to get the property on his books. He told Mrs Gooding to read as many as she wanted and while she was doing that he'd walk round the house, take some photos and measure up the rooms.

Mrs Gooding waved him away without looking up and muttered "fine" under her breath.

For just a moment Joe sat back and looked at the scene. He'd spent over an hour opposite her, doing what good sales people do; getting to know his potential client, finding out her likes and dislikes and trying to figure out exactly what he needed to say to close the deal.

And here she was, completely mesmerised by a few dog eared, crumpled up letters and cards. His thoughts of a signature today were fading fast.

He picked up his camera and set off round the house. As he made his way to the first floor, he thought maybe coming back with some great images would be the thing he needed to get her re-engaged.

About half an hour later Joe made his way back to where he'd left Mrs Gooding. In that time he'd thought carefully about how to bring this meeting to a positive end.

He wasn't giving up...

After all, it was one of the best properties he'd seen all week and was definitely worth the extra time, as long as he could get Mrs Gooding to see what he knew for a fact...That HIS agency really was the best agency in town to choose.

As he rounded the corner into the living room he was completely caught off-guard and stopped in his tracks...

Mrs Gooding was casually leaning back into the deep leather sofa. Gone were the anxious looks and rigid upright sitting position. He even half believed she had a faint relaxed smile on her face.

Before he could collect his thoughts, she sat bolt upright and said..."Where do you want me to sign".

In an instant Joe went from surprised to 'gobsmacked'. He almost had to ask Mrs Gooding to repeat the question. But his deeply engrained professionalism grabbed hold of the situation and stopped him just in time.

With the dexterity of a master magician and in one flowing movement, he instantly produced the contract and a pen, and placed it right in front of her on the coffee table.  
A few seconds later Mrs Gooding handed the signed contract back along with the question "So when do we start?"

On his way down the driveway, after explaining all the post contract steps to Mrs Gooding, Joe felt great. He liked Mrs Gooding and he knew the feeling was mutual. But what the hell was it that made her decide so quickly?

He had to know...

He turned to face Mrs Gooding and in an enquiring voice he said, "Do you mind if I ask you a question?" Mrs Gooding, confident in her choice of estate agent and happy to answer another question, beckoned Joe back to the doorstep.

"Why did you change your mind so quickly about choosing me as your agent?" Joe asked.

Mrs Gooding, now enjoying herself and feeling a little playful, took a deep, exaggerated breath and looked up to the sky as if contemplating the meaning of life.

...Joe waited.

After making him wait a few more tormenting moments, Mrs Gooding looked straight at Joe and said...

"I've had 4 estate agents value my property in the last few days and all of them had very convincing fact and figures, much like yourself.

What made up my mind to choose you was the content in those letters and cards. Their stories were the real proof I needed to make a decision. While facts and figures are interesting, they can be manipulated. But those stories from people in my position who had a great experience with you are impossible to make up."

Joe thanked Mrs Gooding and left pondering her words. Little did he realise that brief conversation would have such a profound effect on the rest of his business life.
